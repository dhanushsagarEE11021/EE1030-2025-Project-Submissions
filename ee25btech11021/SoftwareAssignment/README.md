# 📸 Image Compression using SVD

## 🧠 Overview
This project implements image compression using **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**. 
Power iteration method is used for solving SVD
---

## 🚀 Features
- Read and recontruct the image within the C 
- Implements SVD-based image compression in C
- used power iteration to solve for SVD
- read the grey-scale image and implemented grey-scale image
- power iteration method is considered as fast and storage friendly method.
